# Image Classification Models

This project showcases four different machine learning models designed to classify images into categories. These models use advanced techniques to learn from data and make predictions. Here's a summary of the models and what they do.

## <a href="https://catsanddogsclassifier-argetlam.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Project Overview </a>

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of four different image classification models. Each model is trained to recognize patterns in images and classify them into specific categories. The models included in this project are:

1. **Keras NASNet**: A model designed using Keras, a high-level neural networks API.
2. **Keras MobileNet**: Another model created with Keras, known for its efficiency and accuracy.
3. **PyTorch MobileNet**: A model built using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.
4. **SqueezeNet**: A lightweight model designed to achieve high accuracy with minimal computational resources.

## How It Works

Each model is trained on a dataset of images. The training process involves showing the model many examples of images and their correct classifications. Over time, the model learns to identify the features that distinguish different categories.

## Models Explained

### 1. Keras NASNet
NASNet (Neural Architecture Search Network) is a model architecture that was discovered using machine learning techniques to automate the design of neural networks. This model is designed to provide high accuracy for image classification tasks.

### 2. Keras MobileNet
MobileNet is designed for mobile and edge devices. It is efficient and fast, making it ideal for applications where computational power is limited. Despite its lightweight nature, it performs very well on image classification tasks.

### 3. PyTorch MobileNet
Similar to the Keras MobileNet, this model is implemented using PyTorch. PyTorch is another deep learning framework that provides flexibility and ease of use. This model is also efficient and suitable for mobile applications.

### 4. SqueezeNet
SqueezeNet is a smaller, faster model that achieves accuracy comparable to larger models. It is designed to use fewer parameters, which means it requires less memory and computation power, making it ideal for devices with limited resources.

## Getting Started

To get started with these models, you'll need to set up your environment with the necessary libraries and dependencies. Follow these steps:

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cats_and_dogs_classifier`
3. Install the required libraries:
    - For Keras models: `pip install keras`
    - For PyTorch models: `pip install torch`
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks provided to see the models in action.

## Usage

Each model is provided as a Jupyter notebook. You can open these notebooks and run the code cells to train the models and make predictions on your own images. The notebooks include detailed instructions and explanations for each step.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the capabilities of different image classification models. By comparing these models, you can see how different architectures and frameworks perform on the same task. Whether you're a developer looking to implement an efficient model on a mobile device or just curious about machine learning, this project provides valuable insights.
